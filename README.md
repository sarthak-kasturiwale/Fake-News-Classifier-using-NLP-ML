# Fake-News-Classifier-using-NLP-and-ML
- Fake news is untrue information presented as news. It often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity, or making money through advertising revenue.
- The prevalence of fake news has increased with the rise of social media, especially the Facebook News Feed. Political polarization, post-truth politics, confirmation bias and social media algorithms have been implicated in the spread of fake news.
-It is sometimes generated and propagated by hostile foreign actors, particularly during elections. The use of anonymously-hosted fake news websites has made it difficult to prosecute sources of fake news for libel. 
- In some definitions, fake news includes satirical articles misinterpreted as genuine, and articles that employ sensationalist or clickbait headlines that are not supported in the text. 
- So in this project we are going to develop a machine learning program to identify whether a news is fake or not fake by using natural language processing and Machine Learning.

# Dataset Description
- The dataset has downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/
- It consist of 

1. train.csv: A full training dataset with the following attributes:
    - id: unique id for a news article
    - title: the title of a news article
    - author: author of the news article
    - text: the text of the article; could be incomplete
    - label: a label that marks the article as potentially unreliable
        1. 1: unreliable
        2. 0: reliable

2. test.csv: A testing training dataset with all the same attributes at train.csv without the label.
