# Fake-News-Classifier-using-NLP-ML
Fake news[a] is untrue information presented as news.[3][4][5] It often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity, or making money through advertising revenue.[6][7][8]  Once common in print, the prevalence of fake news has increased with the rise of social media, especially the Facebook News Feed.[6][9][10] Political polarization, post-truth politics, confirmation bias,[11] and social media algorithms have been implicated in the spread of fake news.[3][6][12][13] It is sometimes generated and propagated by hostile foreign actors, particularly during elections.[14][15] The use of anonymously-hosted fake news websites has made it difficult to prosecute sources of fake news for libel.[3][16] In some definitions, fake news includes satirical articles misinterpreted as genuine, and articles that employ sensationalist or clickbait headlines that are not supported in the text. So in this project we are going toDevelop a machine learning program to identify when an article might be fake news.
